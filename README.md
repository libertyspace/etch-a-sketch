# etch-a-sketch

The Etch a Sketch Project from The Odin Project.

The goal is to make a Grid where you can paint, when you hover over the Grid with your Mouse.
It should be completly done in Javascript.

I made all the HTML elements with javascript to get a better grip for working with the DOM.
I wanted to build it a bit more functional (click and drag to draw), but it wasnt set as a goal in the TOP. I have spend a lot of my time to make the Click and drag drawing to work.

Clicking and draging to draw didnt work out for me. It will be the first thing I will try to make it work, when I come back to the Project in the Future.
